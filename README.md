**Echoes**

This is a creative chatbot that would pass the Turing Test, engaging a human on any subject.

It can engage in clear and convincing conservation and adjust to your interests and choices. 
Once it learns a subject, it can share its entire knowledge to another machine in a matter of seconds, making it super scalable.

It uses a keyless memoryless architecture with generative models created and modified as the user interacts with it.

One of the things that is required to hold a conversation is to remember and recollect past conversations and other information. 
You get people angry if you make them repeat the same thing. The closest we get for this time delayed feedback is a Recurrent Neural Network.

But RNN would need to store every piece of the conversation if it has to remember a long term memory, say something that was told at the start of a hour long conversation.

Long Short Term Memory is a special kind of RNN capable of learning Long Term dependecies. We  use a version of LSTM here for the chatbot.



Note: The MNIST data and code is just used as an example. Please stay tuned for generative models integration.
